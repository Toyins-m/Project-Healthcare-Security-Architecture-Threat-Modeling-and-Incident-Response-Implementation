# Healthcare Security Architecture, Threat Modeling, and Incident Response Implementation

## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains all deliverables for a healthcare cybersecurity architecture and threat-modeling engagement. The project simulates the end-to-end security lifecycle for a healthcare provider, including:
- Data classification & governance
- Risk assessments using NIST CSF
- Threat analysis & mitigation
- Incident response (USB-borne malware attack scenario)
- System hardening (server, OS, network, database, physical security)
- Security auditing (based on the IIA toolkit)
- Strategic recommendations for ongoing compliance and resilience
Deliverables were created using real cybersecurity frameworks and mapped directly to healthcare regulatory requirements.

## 🎯 Objectives / Goals
- Implement a healthcare-grade data classification standard to protect PHI, PII, and financial data 
- Conduct a risk assessment & action plan following NIST CSF Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover
- Perform threat modeling and analyze vulnerabilities across IT and clinical systems
- Simulate and document a malware attack & breach scenario, including containment and lessons learned
- Implement system hardening & auditing for Windows-based healthcare systems
- Strengthen organizational resilience by applying cybersecurity controls aligned with HIPAA, NIST CSF, and industry standards

## 🧠 Skills Learned
- Threat Modeling (healthcare infrastructure)
- Security Architecture & Hardening
- Data Classification & Governance (HIPAA compliance)
- Malware analysis (USB-borne malware) & incident response
- Risk Assessment & Mitigation (NIST CSF)
- Identity & Access Management (RBAC, MFA)
- SIEM, IDS, logging, and continuous monitoring
- Vulnerability assessments & penetration testing principles
- Policy writing and audit documentation (IIA toolkit)
